# CoursePlan - Course Enrollment System

## Overview

**CoursePlan** is a role-based web application designed to simplify course management and enrollment within an educational organization. Mentors can create and manage courses, while students can enroll in courses, monitor their learning progress, and update their course completion status.

The application follows a role-based architecture with separate dashboards for **Mentors** and **Students** and uses **JSON Server** as a mock REST API backend.
